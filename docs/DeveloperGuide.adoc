== Introduction

The LeagueTracker is a CLI (Command Line Interface) application written in OOP fashion with a very basic GUI.
This application is adapted from AddressBook3. It is created to provide league managers a football league operator with an efficient method of managing the league in the current season. It features many ways to keep track of the teams and players playing in the league. The LeagueTracker will make useful information of the league managed to be more organized and accessible. +

This Developer Guide provides you useful information regarding setting, coding and testing of League Tracker.

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later

. *IntelliJ* IDE


=== Setting up the project in your computer
To set up this project on our computer: +

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.addressbook.Main` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level3` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level3`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your teamName fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a teamName repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

== Design

=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the League Tracker.
Given below is a quick overview of each component. +

*Main* has only one class called `Main`. It is responsible for:

* At app launch: Initializing the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.

* At shut down: Shutting down the components.


*Logic* is the command executor.

*Data* Holds the data of the League Tracker in-memory.

*Storage* Reads data from, and writes data to the hard disk.

=== Main Component
.Class Disgram showcasing the structure of Main Component
image::Uicomponent.png[width="600"]

The Main Component consists of a UI package and a `Main` class. Inside the UI package, there are various classes such
as `MainWindow`, `Formatter` and `Gui` as shown in figure 2. A `Stoppable` interface is also included which
the `main` class implements.

The UI package uses JavaFX UI framework. Layout of `MainWindow` is defined in `mainwindow.fxml` which can be found
under the same package.

The Main Component:

* Displays the CLI Gui

* Accepts input from users

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` Component

* Listens for changes to `Data`


=== Logic Component
.Class Disgram showcasing the structure of Logic Component
image::Logiccomponent.png[width="600"]

The Logic Component has a `Logic` package with a `Logic` class and a `Parser` package with a `Parser` class.

1. `Logic` uses `Parser` class in the `Parser` package to parse the user command

2. This produces a `Command` object which is executed by `Logic`.

3. The command execution can affect `Data`

4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to Ui.

5. This `CommandResult` object can also invoke actions at Ui such as displaying a message or a summary.


=== Data Component

=== Storage Component
 [to be edited]

=== Common Classes
Classes used by multiple components (eg.Utils.java) are collated in the `seedu.addressbook.common` package.
(`main` > `src` > `seedu` > `addressbook` > `common`)

== Implementation
 [to be edited]
In this section, the detailed implementations of classes and features will be shown.

== Documentation
Following AddressBook3, our League Tracker uses AsciiDoc for writing documentation.We choose AsciiDoc as it provides both a human-readable,
plain-text writing format as well as a text processor and toolchain that are able to translate AsciiDoc documents into different formats(called backend),
including HTML,DocBook and PDF.

=== Editing Documentation
In your IntelliJ IDE, open `Main` > `docs` > `templates` and select the documentation file (eg. `DeveloperGuide.adoc`) to open and edit.
IntelliJ IDE will notify to download the AsciiDoc Plugin. With the plugin, a preview of the documentation will be shown on the screen when the documentation is being
edited for ease of developers.

=== Publishing Documentation
Auto-publishing of documentations has been enabled in League Tracker using Travis CI. A guide of doing so is provided below.

1. Ensure that you have set up Travis CI properly for the project.

2. On Github, create a new user account give this account collaborator and admin access to the repo.
   Using this account, generate a personal access token using this link: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new

[TIP]
Personal access tokens serve as passwords so they must be kept secret to protect your accounts. Delete and regenerate if it is leaked.

[TIP]
We use a new user account to generate the token for teamName projects to prevent teamName members from gaining access to other teamName members' repos.
    If you are the only one with write access to the repo, you can use your own account to generate the token.

   * Add a description for the token. (e.g. Travis CI - auto-publishing)
   * Check the `public repo` checkbox.
   * Click `Generate Token` to grant access for Travis CI to the repo of the project.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Use asciidoctor to convert AsciiDoc files in docs to HTML format. Generated HTML files can be found in `build/docs`.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)


== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.
